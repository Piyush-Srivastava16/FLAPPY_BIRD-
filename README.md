A simple version of the popular Flappy Bird game using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
 
The game is easy to play:

Click the "SPACE " or "Arrow UP" button to make the bird fly and avoid obstacles like pipes to score points.

Press ''ESCAPE'' button to "PAUSE" & "ENTER" button to "RESUME " the game .

It’s a fun project that helped me improve my skills in front-end development and gain more experience in game mechanics.

Here’s how I built it:

HTML: Used to create the game structure and basic layout.

CSS: Styled the game elements, making the bird, pipes, background, and score display look visually appealing.

JavaScript​: This is where the magic happens! The game logic, collision detection, scoring, and bird movement are all powered by JavaScript. It controls the game’s dynamics, including pipe generation, the bird’s flight physics, and handling user input.
